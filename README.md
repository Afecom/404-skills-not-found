# 🧠 404-skills-not-found

> “Page not found. Skills under development.” 🚧

This is my chaotic learning zone — a no-pressure, high-typo, caffeine-fueled repo where I practice, break, fix, and learn everything I can about software development. From writing `<html>` tags to wiring full-stack apps, it all happens here.

## 📚 What to Expect

🧪 A mixed bag of:
- 🧱 **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics**
- ⚛️ Front-end frameworks like **React**
- 🔙 Back-end stuff (Node, APIs, etc.)
- 🐍 Languages I’m picking up (Python, C, etc.)
- ⚙️ Tooling practice — Git, CLI, VS Code tips
- 💡 Mini projects and random ideas

> If it looks broken, it probably is. But that’s how I learn.
